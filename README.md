# Autorrent
An easier way to download and sort your torrent files.

**DISCLAIMER:** This script is intended for use only for legal P2P torrents only.
Any other use is not advised, recommended, or endorsed.

### Outline
1) Add torrent links to a .txt list
2) Run script
3) Autotorrent will open your torrent program (if needed)
4) One-by-one, A.T. will create the folders for each file

When torrent is done
1) Using regex, cleanup file names and delete any junk files

### TODO
- Have user inputs/prompts instead of default values (save locations, etc)
- Make compatible multiple Operating Systems
